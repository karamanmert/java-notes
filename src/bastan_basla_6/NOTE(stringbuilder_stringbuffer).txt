String objects are immutable. (DEĞİŞMEZ)
Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.

StringBuffer Class.
Değişebilir (mutable) string objeleri oluşturmak için kullanılır.

append():
StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("Hello ");
sb.append("Java");//now original string is changed
System.out.println(sb);//prints Hello Java

StringBuilder class ->
String buffer ile aynı işi yapar

Farkı:
    StringBuilder -> non-synchronized.
    StringBuffer -> non-synchronized.

How to create Immutable class in Java?

Immutable class in java means that once an object is created,
we cannot change its content.
In Java, all the wrapper classes (like Integer, Boolean, Byte, Short) and String class is immutable.
We can create our own immutable class as well.
Prior to going ahead do go through characteristics of immutability in order to have a good understanding while implementing the same.
Following are the requirements:

The class must be declared as final so that child classes can’t be created.
Data members in the class must be declared private so that direct access is not allowed.
Data members in the class must be declared as final so that we can’t change the value of it after object creation.
A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields performing a deep copy so that data members can’t be modified with an object reference.
Deep Copy of objects should be performed in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference)
